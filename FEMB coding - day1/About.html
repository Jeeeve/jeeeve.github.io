<body>
    <p>I am Evelyn, a Malaysian living in Sweden. I work as a teacher. </p>
    <p>I am interested in coding and have been learning how to code in the past two months through online bootcamps and short courses. I hope that one day I would be able to build a website of a company that I own with a friend. Also, I would like to create a language learning website, as a final goal. If I end up getting paid through coding, in any form, I would be very pleased. </p>

    <p>Three important things to know about me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am a mother to a wonderful girl, Clara.</li>
            <li>I am a lifelong learner who is interested in languages, craft and life.</li>
            <li>I am very lucky to have a loving family and surrounded by wonderful friends.</li>
        </ul>
